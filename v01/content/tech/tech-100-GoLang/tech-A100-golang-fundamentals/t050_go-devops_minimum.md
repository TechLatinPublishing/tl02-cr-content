## Summary
As a Dev/Ops engineer on a team. You should understand the development ceremony of 
1. Create a Feature branch off of Master.
2. Develope the code
3. Create update the test Unit cases and confirm they pass
4. Push your branch to Remote
5. Confirm Unit and Integration is passing.
6. Before a PR ( Pull Request ) to master, you should clean up the commit comments using rebase.  Remember that you are asking for your team mates to Give you the "LGTM" ( looks good to me).  Your work will reflect on everyone in your team and teams around you.
7. You should be involved in doing PR reviews of your team members. PR review has three objectives:
    - Comment on their coding style, leave remarks on what needs to me cleaned up, make sugestions.  
    - Understand what the code does so you become a redundant engineering resource. 
    - Learn what your team mates are doing so you can be productive during standups. 
    - Stop bad code before it is permitted into the Mast branch.
